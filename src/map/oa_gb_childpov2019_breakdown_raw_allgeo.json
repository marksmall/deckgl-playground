Relative low-income is defined as a family whose equivalised income is below 60 per cent of contemporary median income. Gross income measure is Before Housing Costs and includes contributions from earnings, state support and pensions. A family must have claimed one or more of Universal Credit, Tax Credits or Housing Benefit at any point in the year to be classed as low income in these statistics. For the purposes of the breakdown statistics, working families are those in which either the adult claimant of Child Benefit or any partners have an accumulated period of at least 26 weeks paid employment or self-employment within the tax year. Note the source data are subject to introduced random errors to minimise the risk of identifying individuals: this means that small numbers may not be perfectly accurate, and in some cases therefore the breakdown statistics do not add up to the total.",
